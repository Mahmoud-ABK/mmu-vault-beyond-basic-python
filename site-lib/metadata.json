It's essential for analysis, debugging, and storytelling with data.\nMatplotlib: The base library for static plots—flexible but verbose.\nSeaborn: Built on Matplotlib, great for statistical plots with less code.\nPlotly: Interactive and web-friendly, ideal for dashboards and presentations.\nIn Python plotting, the Figure and Axes are your primary building blocks:\nFigure:\nThe figure serves as the overall container or \"canvas\" for your plot. It can house one or more axes (subplots), and it defines the space where everything is rendered. The figure can be thought of as the full page or the entire window in which your plots are drawn.\nAxes (Subplots):\nThe axes are the individual plots or charts contained within the figure. Each axes object includes its own x and y (and possibly z) coordinate systems, along with elements such as titles, labels, grids, and legends. When you create multiple axes, you’re essentially dividing the figure into sections.\nFor example, in Matplotlib you can create a figure with multiple axes using:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2) # Creates a 2x2 grid of subplots Each axes (axes[0, 0], axes[0, 1], etc.) is an independent container where you can plot data.\nfor vizualisation :<br> <img alt=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/_images/users-explain-axes-axes_intro-1.2x.png\" src=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/_images/users-explain-axes-axes_intro-1.2x.png\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/axes/axes_intro.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/axes/axes_intro.html\" target=\"_self\">source</a>in essence: **An \"axe\" (or more precisely, Axes in Matplotlib) is a single subplot.\nMore technically: Figure → The whole canvas (think of it like a page).\nAxes → A section of the figure where data is plotted (i.e. the actual subplot).\nAxis → The X-axis or Y-axis (the lines and ticks inside an Axes). We'll explore more syntax later When creating plots in Python, particularly with Matplotlib, you have two main approaches:\nStateful Approach (using pyplot):\nThis approach relies on the current active figure and axes. Functions in the pyplot module, such as plt.plot() or plt.title(), implicitly act on the last created or current axes.\nPros: Quick to use for simple plots or during interactive sessions (e.g., in Jupyter Notebooks).\nLess verbose; you don’t have to manage individual axes explicitly.\nCons:\nCan lead to confusion when dealing with multiple figures or complex plotting logic, as it depends on implicit state management. Object-Oriented Approach (using Figure and Axes objects):\nThis method involves creating figure and axes objects explicitly (e.g., with plt.subplots()) . You then call methods on these objects to create and customize your plots. fig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nax.set_title(\"Sample Plot\")\nPros:\nOffers explicit control over each component of the plot, which enhances modularity and reusability. Avoids issues related to the global state, making it easier to manage multiple plots or subplots within the same figure.\nCons:\nSlightly more verbose and requires a bit more setup for very simple plots.\nBuilding a clear and informative plot involves several key components:\nTitle and Axis Labels:\nProviding a meaningful title and clear axis labels is essential for context. They help your audience understand the subject matter of the plot at a glance.\nax.set_title(\"Growth Over Time\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Time (years)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Growth (%)\") Legend:\nWhen your plot contains multiple data series, a legend helps distinguish them by mapping colors, shapes, or line styles to each series. Legends improve the readability of the plot and guide the viewer in interpreting the data correctly.\nax.plot(x, y1, label=\"Dataset 1\")\nax.plot(x, y2, label=\"Dataset 2\")\nax.legend() Grid:\nGridlines can enhance the readability of a plot by aligning data points with the corresponding numerical values on the axes. They are particularly useful in plots that involve detailed numerical analysis.\nax.grid(True) Annotations:\nAnnotations are useful for highlighting key points or adding explanatory text directly on the plot. They can include text labels, arrows, and other markers to draw attention to significant data points.\nax.annotate('Peak Value', xy=(2, 5), xytext=(3, 6), arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05)) <br><img alt=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/_images/sphx_glr_anatomy_001.png\" src=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/_images/sphx_glr_anatomy_001.png\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\"><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html\" target=\"_self\">source </a>Matplotlib is one of the most widely used libraries in Python for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It serves as the groundwork for many other plotting libraries and offers both a quick, stateful interface for simple plots as well as an object-oriented approach for more complex visuals.actually we explored some syntax in the last section but this is more structuredimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np # Generate sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x) # Create a figure and an axes object\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5)) # Set figure size # Plot data\nax.plot(x, y, label='sin(x)') # Add basic customizations\nax.set_title(\"Sine Wave Example\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"x (radians)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"sin(x)\")\nax.legend() # Display the plot\nplt.show() plt.subplots() creates a figure (fig) and axes (ax), with optional parameters like figsize to control dimensions.\nax.plot() draws data on the specified axes, supporting various styles and formats.\nMethods like set_title() set_xlabel(), and set_ylabel() add context, while legend() clarifies data series.\nUse plt.figure() for a blank canvas or plt.subplot() for manual multi-plot layouts\nPro Tip: For complex plots, prefer the object-oriented approach (fig, ax = plt.subplots()) over plt.plot() to avoid confusion with multiple axes.\noutput of the plot below<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250414174928.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250414174928.png\" target=\"_self\">Input Data:\nx (optional): Array/list of x-values.

Large datasets (e.g., millions of data points) can slow down plotting, increase memory usage, or produce cluttered visualizations. Here are strategies to optimize plotting for large datasets:\nDownsampling: Reduce the number of points plotted by sampling or aggregating data.\nExample: Plot every nth point or use statistical summaries (e.g., mean, median). Use Appropriate Plot Types: Scatter plots with many points can become unreadable; consider hexbin plots, 2D histograms, or contour plots for density visualization. Optimize Rendering: Use Matplotlib’s Agg backend for non-interactive plotting to save memory.\nReduce marker sizes or use line plots instead of scatter for dense data. Leverage Vectorized Operations: Use NumPy for computations to avoid slow Python loops. Seaborn for Aggregated Plots: Seaborn’s statistical plots (e.g., boxplot, violinplot) automatically summarize data, reducing the need to plot every point. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns # Generate large dataset (1M points)\nnp.random.seed(42)\nx = np.random.randn(1_000_000)\ny = x + np.random.randn(1_000_000) * 0.5 # Downsample: Take every 100th point\nsample_idx = np.arange(0, len(x), 100)\nx_sample = x[sample_idx]\ny_sample = y[sample_idx] # Create figure with two subplots\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5)) # Scatter plot (downsampled)\nax1.scatter(x_sample, y_sample, s=5, alpha=0.5, color='blue')\nax1.set_title(\"Downsampled Scatter (10K points)\")\nax1.set_xlabel(\"X\")\nax1.set_ylabel(\"Y\") # Hexbin plot (full dataset)\nhb = ax2.hexbin(x, y, gridsize=50, cmap='viridis', mincnt=1)\nax2.set_title(\"Hexbin Plot (1M points)\")\nax2.set_xlabel(\"X\")\nax2.set_ylabel(\"Y\")\nfig.colorbar(hb, ax=ax2, label='Counts') plt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250613145637.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250613145637.png\" target=\"_self\">\nThe right subplot uses a hexbin plot to visualize the full 1M points, with hexagonal bins showing density (darker = more points).<br>\nsee <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/hexbin_demo.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/hexbin_demo.html\" target=\"_self\">hexagonal binning</a>\n<br>\nwe're going to revisit a bit <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Plotting in Python > 2.1 Figures and Axes The Plotting Canvas\" data-href=\"Plotting in Python#2.1 Figures and Axes The Plotting Canvas\" href=\"plotting-in-python.html#2.1_Figures_and_Axes_The_Plotting_Canvas_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Figures and Axes: The Plotting Canvas</a> Subplots allow you to display multiple plots within a single figure, ideal for comparing datasets or visualizing different aspects of the same data.

A more complex function can handle multiple plot types, advanced styling, and robust error handling to accommodate various use cases.\nFlexibility: Support multiple plot types (e.g., line, scatter) and customization options (e.g., colors, markers, legends).\nError Handling: Validate inputs for data compatibility and user errors.\nReturn Objects: Return fig and ax for further customization.\nDocumentation: Use detailed docstrings to clarify parameters and usage.\nCombining different plot types (e.g., scatter and line, or histogram and KDE) in a single axes or figure can highlight relationships or comparisons effectively.\nMultiple Plot Calls: Use multiple ax.plot(), ax.scatter(), etc., on the same axes.\nTwin Axes: Use ax.twinx() or ax.twiny() to plot different scales on the same subplot.\nLegends: Ensure all plot elements are labeled for clarity.\nSeaborn + Matplotlib: Use Seaborn for statistical plots and Matplotlib for additional overlays. shares the range of x and y axis (value range) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n# Generate sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny1 = np.sin(x)\ny2 = np.cos(x) # Create figure and axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5)) # Plot scatter and line\nax.scatter(x[::5], y1[::5], color='blue', label='sin(x)', s=50, alpha=0.6)\nax.plot(x, y2, color='red', linestyle='--', label='cos(x)') # Customize\nax.set_title('Scatter and Line Overlay')\nax.set_xlabel('X (radians)')\nax.set_ylabel('Y')\nax.legend()\nax.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.6) plt.tight_layout()\nplt.show() <br> <img alt=\"Pasted image 20250613154311.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250613154311.png\" target=\"_self\">Explanation:\nOverlays a scatter plot of sin(x) (every 5th point) and a line plot of cos(x) on the same axes.\nUses distinct colors and a legend to differentiate the plots. share the same x axis import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np # Generate sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny1 = np.sin(x)\ny2 = x**2 # Create figure and primary axes\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5)) # Plot on primary y-axis (sin(x))\nax1.plot(x, y1, color='blue', label='sin(x)')\nax1.set_xlabel('X (radians)')\nax1.set_ylabel('sin(x)', color='blue')\nax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='blue') # Create secondary y-axis (x^2)\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\nax2.plot(x, y2, color='red', linestyle='--', label='x^2')\nax2.set_ylabel('x^2', color='red')\nax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='red') # Combine legends\nlines1, labels1 = ax1.get_legend_handles_labels()\nlines2, labels2 = ax2.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax1.legend(lines1 + lines2, labels1 + labels2, loc='upper left') fig.suptitle('Line Plot with Secondary Y-Axis')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show() <br> <img alt=\"Pasted image 20250613154234.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250613154234.png\" target=\"_self\">Explanation:\nax1.twinx() creates a secondary y-axis (ax2) sharing the same x-axis.\nPlots sin(x) on the primary y-axis and x^2 on the secondary y-axis, which accommodates the different scales (sin(x) ranges -1 to 1, x^2 ranges 0 to 100).\nColor-coded labels and ticks improve readability. share the same y axis import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np # Data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x) # Create the main plot\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots()\nax1.plot(x, y, color='blue')\nax1.set_xlabel('Time (seconds)')\nax1.set_ylabel('Amplitude')\nax1.set_title('twiny() Example - Two X Axes') # Create a twin x-axis (shares the y-axis)\nax2 = ax1.twiny() # Set a different scale for the top x-axis (e.g., time in minutes)\nax2.set_xlim(ax1.get_xlim()) # Make sure they align\nax2.set_xticks(np.linspace(0, 10, 6))\nax2.set_xticklabels([f'{t/60:.2f}' for t in np.linspace(0, 10, 6)])\nax2.set_xlabel('Time (minutes)') plt.show() <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250613162408.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250613162408.png\" target=\"_self\">\nExplanation:\nax1.twiny() creates a secondary x-axis (ax2) sharing the same y-axis.\nPlots sin(x) with x-axis in seconds (primary) and hours (secondary, where minutes= seconds/60).\nDemonstrates how twiny() is used for different x-axis scales (e.g., different units).

Use twiny() for different x-axis scales (e.g., time in different units).\nLegend Management: Combine legends from multiple axes or plots using get_legend_handles_labels() to avoid clutter.\nSeaborn + Matplotlib: Use Seaborn for quick statistical plots and Matplotlib for precise overlays or customizations.\nReadability: Limit combined plots to 2–3 elements to avoid visual overload.\nPlotting libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn can throw errors due to incorrect inputs, library-specific quirks, or environmental issues. Check Inputs: Inspect data shapes, types, and content before plotting to catch issues early.\nUpdate Libraries: Keep Matplotlib and Seaborn updated to avoid bugs in older versions.\nMinimal Example: Reproduce errors with small datasets to isolate the problem quickly.\nand most importantly , Read the Error carefully , most errors are self-explanatory and DO NOT require even prompting.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"a part of beyond basics python","level":4,"id":"a_part_of_beyond_basics_python_0"},{"heading":"<em>Table of Contents</em>","level":2,"id":"*Table_of_Contents*_0"},{"heading":"<em>Table of Contents</em>","level":2,"id":"_Table_of_Contents__0"},{"heading":"<strong>Plotting in Python</strong>","level":1,"id":"**Plotting_in_Python**_0"},{"heading":"1.

Each virtual environment can contain a different set of libraries, allowing multiple projects to coexist without version conflicts.\nDependency Isolation: Ensures that each project uses the specific versions of packages it needs. Reproducibility: Other developers can recreate the same environment to match your project setup. Avoiding Conflicts: Different projects can have different (and often incompatible) library versions. Minimal Global Footprint: Reduces clutter in the system-wide Python installation or the Anaconda base environment.\nA typical Python virtual environment contains something like:myenv/\n├── bin/\n│ ├── activate\n│ ├── python\n│ └── pip\n├── lib/\n│ └── python3.11/\n│ └── site-packages/\n└── include/ bin/: Houses utilities (e.g., Python executables and the activate script). lib/: Contains installed libraries, typically under site-packages. include/: Stores header files for compiled modules or libraries.\n# Create a virtual environment with the built-in venv module\npython3 -m venv myenv # Activate the environment (Linux/Mac)\nsource myenv/bin/activate # Activate the environment (Windows)\nmyenv\\Scripts\\activate # Deactivate when done\ndeactivate\nIf you do not require Conda’s advanced dependency resolution or cross-language management, Python’s built-in venv is sufficient for many lightweight workflows.When working on a project with others or setting up the same environment on another machine, you can share your virtual environment setup using a requirements file or a lock file.pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\npython3 -m venv myenv # Create a new virtual environment\nsource myenv/bin/activate # Activate it (Windows: myenv\\Scripts\\activate)\npip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies\nAnaconda3 is a distribution of Python and R widely used in data science due to its convenient packaging of essential libraries (NumPy, pandas, etc.). It ships with the Conda package manager, offering sophisticated dependency resolution and environment management.\nAnaconda vs Conda : Anaconda is a full-fledged distribution that includes Python, R, Conda, and many commonly used data science libraries.\nConda is the package manager and environment manager that can be used independently from Anaconda (e.g., in Miniconda), allowing you to install only the packages you need. Base Environment:\nThe environment installed by default whens you set up Anaconda. It often includes fundamental data-science packages.\nUser-Created Environments:\nThese are additional environments made with Conda. You can isolate new projects in separate environments for optimal dependency management. System-Wide: Environments stored in a central directory (e.g., /opt/anaconda3/envs/) are accessible to all users on that system (with appropriate permissions). Path-Specific: Environments created or moved to custom folders within a project directory. Useful for grouping your environment with the codebase itself (ensuring all required dependencies are self-contained).\nConda keeps a versatile environment index.\nKey commands:<br><img alt=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQElU5Sk22RUeA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1681478776234?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=VrKzoDN1tojtDsKgFcjy-8rqgcdfGS71A3tN2pohiAc\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQElU5Sk22RUeA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1681478776234?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=VrKzoDN1tojtDsKgFcjy-8rqgcdfGS71A3tN2pohiAc\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">Within an Anaconda install, you commonly find a layout like:/opt/anaconda3/\n├── envs/\n│ ├── base/\n│ ├── myenv/\n│ └── ...\n└── ... envs/: Subdirectory that stores multiple Conda environments. environment.yml: A YAML file used to record or reconstruct specific environments. It includes dependencies, Python version, and more.\n# 1) Download the installer (e.g. Anaconda3-*.sh) from the official website\n# 2) Run the installer\nbash Anaconda3-*.sh # 3) Follow the prompts and accept license terms\n# 4) Add Conda to your PATH in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc when asked\nsource ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc\n# Display Conda info (including environment locations)\nconda info # Show version\nconda --version # List installed packages\nconda list # Update Conda itself\nconda update conda # Create a new environment\nconda create -n myenv python=3.11 # Activate/deactivate environment\nconda activate myenv\nconda deactivate # List environments\nconda env list # Remove an environment\nconda env remove -n myenv\nenvironment.yml files facilitate environment replication and sharing. The structure includes:name: myenv\nchannels: - defaults\ndependencies: - python=3.11 # pinned Python version - numpy # external dependencies - pandas - matplotlib - jupyterlab - ipykernel - pip name: The environment name (e.g., myenv). channels: Source(s) where packages are fetched (e.g., defaults, conda-forge, etc.). dependencies: Packages (with optional versions). You can also specify pip requirements by including:\n- pip: - my-special-library==1.2.3 Usage: # Create an environment from a YAML file\nconda env create -f environment.yml # Export an existing environment\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml If you want to create a Conda environment in a project-specific folder, run:conda create --prefix /home/user/projects/my_project/env python=3.11 Why Path-Specific? Keeps your environment localized to the project directory.\nEases portability when sharing code (especially if you commit environment files or relocate the entire folder). Activating a Path-Specific Environment:\nconda activate /home/user/projects/my_project/env Listing Packages for Projects:\nconda list --prefix /home/user/projects/my_project/env This approach helps you precisely control the environment location without cluttering the\nglobal envs/ directory. Advanced commands (CheatSheet): # 1. Install a package from a specific channel (e.g., conda-forge)\nconda install -n myenv -c conda-forge scikit-learn # 2. Downgrade a package to a specific version\nconda install -n myenv numpy=1.18 # 3. Show environment details (including active packages)\nconda list -n myenv # 4. Clone an existing environment\nconda create --name newenv --clone oldenv # 5. Update all packages in an environment\nconda update --all # 6. Check for outdated packages\nconda update --dry-run # Shows what would be updated # 7. Search for a package across all channels\nconda search &lt;package-name&gt; # 8. Install a package from a .tar.bz2 file\nconda install /path/to/package.tar.bz2 # 9. Remove a specific package from an environment\nconda remove -n myenv package_name # 10. Clean unused packages and caches\nconda clean --all # Frees up disk space Advanced users often configure .condarc or environment variables to override default Conda behaviors (e.g., specifying custom channels, turning off auto_activate_base, etc.). These settings can significantly streamline and automate environment workflows.Editing your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to include aliases is a simple productivity boost:alias activate_ds=\"conda activate data-science\"\nalias activate_ml=\"conda activate machine-learning\"\nalias envs=\"conda env list\"\nalias jl=\"jupyter lab\"\nReload your shell:source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc\nYou may create a “skeleton” directory that holds:my_skeleton/\n├── environment.yml\n├── src/\n│ └── ...\n├── tests/\n│ └── ...\n└── README.md Purpose: Ensures every new project has a standardized layout. Usage: Copy this skeleton when starting a new project, then run:\ncd new_project\nconda env create -f environment.yml This seamlessly provisions your environment with predefined settings (e.g., pinned Python versions, essential packages). Pip:\nPython’s default package installer. Ideal for lightweight virtual environments (using venv) and installing packages from PyPI. Conda:\nA robust environment and package manager from Anaconda/Miniconda. It manages dependencies well, especially for data science projects. Mamba:\nA faster, C++ reimplementation of Conda. It uses the same commands as Conda but speeds up package resolution and installation. # ----- Using Pip (with venv) -----\npython3 -m venv myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\npip install numpy pandas scikit-learn # ----- Using Conda -----\nconda create -n myenv python=3.11 -y\nconda activate myenv\nconda install numpy pandas scikit-learn -y # ----- Using Mamba -----\n# First, install mamba in your base environment if not already installed:\nconda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge -y\n# Then create and activate an environment, and install packages:\nmamba create -n myenv python=3.11 -y\nconda activate myenv\nmamba install numpy pandas scikit-learn -y Never mix&nbsp;conda&nbsp;and&nbsp;pip&nbsp;in the same environment&nbsp;until all conda options are exhausted.\nUse&nbsp;mamba&nbsp;for daily conda operations and fall back to&nbsp;conda&nbsp;only if edge-case errors occur.\nPrefer&nbsp;conda-forge&nbsp;channel for newer packages\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda config --set channel_priority strict\nJupyter Lab is a powerful IDE-like environment built on top of Jupyter Notebook technology. It integrates notebooks, terminals, file explorers, and more in a flexible UI. Jupyter Lab vs. Google Colab: Jupyter Lab: Run locally or on a server you control, offering complete customizability of packages/kernels. Google Colab: A cloud-based environment with pre-installed packages but limited customization for local library installation. A common practice is to install Jupyter Lab in the base environment:conda install -n base jupyterlab nb_conda_kernels ipykernel jupyterlab: The core application. nb_conda_kernels: Detects kernels from all Conda environments, making them selectable in Jupyter. ipykernel: Enables registering Python environments as Jupyter kernels.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html\" target=\"_self\">further readings: documentation</a>Jupyter’s architecture can be broken down into three main components:\nClient (Front-End): JupyterLab or Notebook interface where code cells are written and rendered. Jupyter Server: Manages incoming requests from the client and dispatches them to the appropriate kernel.\nHandles saving notebooks, etc. Kernel: The computing engine that executes the code. For Python, the kernel is typically powered by ipykernel. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250426180522.png\" src=\"assets/pasted-image-20250426180522.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html#the-jupyter-notebook-interface\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html#the-jupyter-notebook-interface\" target=\"_self\">source</a>\nKernel Registration: The process of informing Jupyter about a specific environment (kernel) so Jupyter Lab can launch and run code within that environment. How It Works: You install ipykernel in a given environment. You run a registration command to add that environment to Jupyter’s kernel list:\nconda activate myenv\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\" Jupyter stores the kernel specification (usually in ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/myenv/ on Linux) so that environment can be selected from the Jupyter Lab UI. By registering multiple environments as kernels, you can switch between them easily within Jupyter Lab—perfect for testing different versions of libraries or using different Python interpreters for various tasks.# Install a specific extension (e.g., Table of Contents)\npip install jupyterlab-toc # Install an extension using Conda (if available)\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-toc # Install multiple useful extensions with pip\npip install jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-toc jupyterlab-variableinspector jupyterlab-lsp python-lsp-server # Install multiple useful extensions with Conda\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-toc jupyterlab-variableinspector jupyterlab-lsp python-lsp-server # Update JupyterLab and all installed extensions (pip)\npip install --upgrade jupyterlab # Update all JupyterLab extensions (pip)\npip install --upgrade jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-toc jupyterlab-variableinspector jupyterlab-lsp python-lsp-server # Update JupyterLab and all installed extensions (Conda)\nconda update -c conda-forge jupyterlab # Update a specific extension (pip)\npip install --upgrade jupyterlab-toc # Update a specific extension (Conda)\nconda update -c conda-forge jupyterlab-toc # Uninstall an extension (pip)\npip uninstall jupyterlab-toc # Uninstall an extension (Conda)\nconda remove jupyterlab-toc # Remove multiple extensions (pip)\npip uninstall jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-variableinspector # Remove multiple extensions (Conda)\nconda remove jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-variableinspector # List all installed JupyterLab extensions (pip)\npip list | grep jupyterlab # List all installed JupyterLab extensions (Conda)\nconda list | grep jupyterlab # Check available kernels in JupyterLab\njupyter kernelspec list # Restart JupyterLab to apply changes\njupyter lab build JupyterLab extensions are now managed as Python packages, making installation easier.
